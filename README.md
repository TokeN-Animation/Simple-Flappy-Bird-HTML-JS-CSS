Game Description:

Simple Flappy Bird is a game where the player controls a bird and tries to fly through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The player can make the bird jump by pressing the space bar or the up arrow key. Each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes, the player's score increases. If the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground, the game ends and the player can choose to play again.
