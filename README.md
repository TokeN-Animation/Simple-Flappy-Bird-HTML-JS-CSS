'index.html' file properly:


Code Description:

'index.html': This is the main HTML file that contains the structure and layout of the web page. It includes the references to the CSS and JS files that contain the styling and functionality for the game.
'style.css': This file contains the styling rules for the game elements, such as the bird, pipes, and background. It also includes the animations for the bird and the score counter.
'script.js': This file contains the game logic, such as the bird's movement and collision detection. It also includes the code for generating the pipes, updating the score, and ending the game when the bird collides with a pipe.

Game Description:

Simple Flappy Bird is a game where the player controls a bird and tries to fly through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The player can make the bird jump by pressing the space bar or the up arrow key. Each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes, the player's score increases. If the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground, the game ends and the player can choose to play again.


Using 'index.html':

To use 'index.html', you should first download the code files and images and save them in a directory on your computer.
Then, open 'index.html' in a web browser to play the game. You can use the arrow keys or space bar to control the bird.
If you want to make changes to the game, you can modify the code in 'style.css' and 'script.js' using a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. After making changes, save the files and refresh the web page to see the updated game.
To share your game on GitHub, you can create a new repository and upload the code files and images. You can then add a README file with instructions on how to use the game and any additional information about the project.
